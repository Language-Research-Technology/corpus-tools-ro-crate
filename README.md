# corpus-tools-spreadsheet
Generic spreadsheet (and Describo) driven tool for creating an LDaCA-ready profile-compliant language corpus that can be loaded into Oni


## Assumptions

USers will use describo to describe the Collection and sub collection structure of their data. as per the [Profile]


This tool will allow people to describe RepositoryObjects (eg PARADISEC or Alveo ITEMS)

Conventions:

Ech object will be in a dir

```
-- object1/
        1.txt
        1.wav
        1.elan
-- objectn/
      ...
      
ro-crate-objects.xlsx

```

ro-crate-object.xlsx will have an objects tab with object level metadata

ro-crate-object sheet can be auto-generated by the tool 

Structure of the spreadsheet

Can always handle multiples. Current method is to use [1,2,3] where there are multiple values -- ALternative is to allow more columns with additional indexes language, language__1, language__2 ---- Aim to handle both

Any property can be added by making a column(s) if it does not match a vocab there will not be an error -- in rocxl you CAN add properties, classes and defined terms in their own sheets TODO: see if we can use Descrino to make a vocab/ dir that has their special terms.

Does not need to repeat the type RepositoryObject (but you may need OTHER types as well, so need a @type column) -- assume RepoObject

Other columns like language --- need to be there, or inherit from the collection structure (which will be alongside, in describo) OR just put in a name or a code and we'll look it up
